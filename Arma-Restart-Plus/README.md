## Arma Restart Plus

This program was meant to be lightweight, open source, resart application for game servers, or what ever you want. It is currentely designed for a restart path on a exile server.

## Highlights:
.Ability to restart different .bat files depending on the time of day

.Will never let Arma fail. Say the server decides it wants to break on you, or something goes wrong and arma3server.exe closes. This will notice that occurrence and restart it.

.Only uses 22 MB of ram, and 1% CPU usage (this was the goal for making it lightweight.)

.You can make all day or all night restarts, which is fairly easy to do because it can load diffrent .bat files.

. Written in C#

.Can restart if computer shuts off



## Problems:
. Needs to be more configurable
